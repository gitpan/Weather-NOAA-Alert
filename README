Weather-NOAA-Alert

Weather::NOAA::Alert will retrieve and parse the NOAA National Weather Service 
ATOM and CAP 1.1 feeds for the specified forecast zones.  It is designed to 
cache previously polled CAP items.  The overall process is to get the 
requested ATOM feed, get any CAP entries that are not in the cache, and store 
the alerts.

You can find the zone list and more information about NOAA watches, warnings,
and advisories at the following sites:
